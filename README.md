This is a messaging system made to handle network issues and instabilities. To test this _Clumsy (https://jagt.github.io/clumsy/)_ was used to simulate network issues and _Postman_ for API testing.

To launch the backend server run:  go run ./cmd/server/main.go

Notes:
- Avast or other more sensitive shields might not allow the program to run. To workaround this you need to disable them
